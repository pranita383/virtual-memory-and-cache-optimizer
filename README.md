# Virtual Memory and Cache Optimizer

## Overview
The **Virtual Memory and Cache Optimizer** is a software tool designed to enhance the performance of memory management in operating systems. By implementing advanced algorithms for virtual memory and cache optimization, this project aims to improve data access speeds and overall system efficiency.

## Objectives
- To develop a tool that optimizes virtual memory management using various page replacement algorithms.
- To implement cache management techniques that enhance data retrieval speeds.
- To provide performance monitoring and feedback to users regarding memory and cache usage.

## Features
- Supports multiple page replacement algorithms (e.g., LRU, FIFO, Optimal).
- Implements various cache replacement policies (e.g., LRU, LFU, Random).
- Provides a user-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.
- Collects and displays performance metrics, including page fault rates and cache hit rates.


## Installation
To set up the Virtual Memory and Cache Optimizer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VirtualMemoryCacheOptimizer.git
   cd VirtualMemoryCacheOptimizer
2. **Installing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects

3. **compile the source code**
   for c/c++
   ```bash
   gcc src/main/main.c -o optimizer -I src/memory_management -I src/cache_management -I src/performance_monitoring

4.**execute optimized program**
   ```bash
   ./optimizer
5. **testing**
  ```bash
  gcc tests/test_memory_management.c -o test_memory_management
  ./test_memory_management
